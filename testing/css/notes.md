# CSS Tests

This folder is a scratchpad for developing the CSS components.

Each content type has a testing page that you can play with to check and develop settings.

Before starting a new type or any major work, ensure you have completed a proof of concept page in the `_assets/_testing` folder working with palin html pages without an reference to the Clik system.

## Set up

Each testing page _should_ have a corresponding style definition and a custom stylesheet in `_styles`. If they haven't, please ensure you standardise the page before doing any work.

A number of test cases are defined within the script and then each one is displayed on the page. To adjust your tests, use the custom stylesheet.
