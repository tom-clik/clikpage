Clikpage is a code-free site publishing suite built with CFML. It's a CMS, template, and design tool rolled into one. It can be used in a live application or to generate static HTML sites.

There are three key parts to it.

1. [Site data](sitedata.md)
    A simple site data model allows sites to be defined using XML or SQL stores. 

2. [Layouts](layouts.md)
    Every site or app is built using a set of layouts. These are more than just templates, they are contructed from modular components and offer huge flexibility for styling and configuration.

3. [Styling](styling.md)
    XML based styles allow for control over styles and interactivity without the need to code HTML or JavaScript.
