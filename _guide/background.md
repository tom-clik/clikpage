Clikpage is a code-free site publishing suite built with CFML. It's a CMS, template, and design tool rolled into one. It can be used in a live application or to generate static HTML sites.

It's component architecture allows it to be easily extended,


There are three key parts to it 

1. Site data
    A simple site data model allows sites to be defined using XML or SQL stores. 

    No pages are edited directly

2. Layouts
    Every site or app is built using a set of layouts. These are more than just templates, they are contructed from modular components and offer huge flexibility for styling and configuration.

3. Styling
    XML based styles allow for complete control over interactivity without need to code JavaScript.
