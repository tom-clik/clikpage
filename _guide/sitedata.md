# Site Data {#sitedata}

Data can be defined at three levels:

1. Site
2. Sections
3. Data sets

Site and Sections are actually a data set themselves, but their definition is pre-defined as they're integral to the Clik system.

## Basic data sets

A basic data set can be defined with a tag(s) and a data type. There are two data types defined as standard, sections and articles, and others can be added as required.

A typical data set is the list of sections to go into a menu. This would be defined as all sections with a tag of "main menu" and sorted by a numerical field.

Article data sets can be created automatically for given tags. These can be used to create featured news for a home page or to divide blog pages into categories.

## Advanced data sets

Some data sets can be defined according to properties of a section. For instance a layout might defined a list of articles or a gallery of photos. The data set assigned to the content might be section.articles, a set that varies according to the section.



## Other data types

Other data types can be defined and then used by custom content sections. These might be products or entries in a reference library.
