# Site Data {#sitedata}

Data can be defined at three levels:

1. Site
2. Sections
3. Data sets

Site and Sections are actually a data set themselves, but their definition is mainly fixed as they're integral to the Clik system.

## Basic data sets

A basic data set can be defined with a tag(s) and a data type. A menu might have a data set defined as "main menu", all sections defined

## Articles

Another standard data type is defined in the Clik system, articles.

## Other data types

Other data types can be defined and then used by custom content sections. These might be products or entries in a reference library.
