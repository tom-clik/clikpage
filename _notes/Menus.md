# Menus

Menus working ok but sub menu styling not done.

css_settings function needs breaking out with a recursive sub function. The sub mneus shouldbn't be in the selectors. It shuold recurse as required to two or three levels.

submenu_position should just be "position" for a sub key.

submenu can have a key of submenu for three layer menus.

Defaults for submenu should be inline for vertical? How??

Icons need sorting somehow.
