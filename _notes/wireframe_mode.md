# Wireframe Mode

Wireframe mode allows you to see all the containers on a layout in a schematic.

The containers can be re-arranged easily and the styling dialog accessed by selecting the container and pressing `S`.

## Implementation

In wireframe mode, the content items are show without any content and just their titles.

### Styling

Applied via the editing.css script. A class of "clikedit" is applied to the body and the styling for divs applied accordingly.

TBC we will probably apply styles dynamically.

#### Background color


### Layers

The layers functionality allows you to remove the content sections according to their position in the document hierarchy.

(assign layer classes according to depth)
