# Justified Grid

So the basic JavaScript plug in works fine. Pretty simple and quite effective.

See `_assets\_testing\justified-gallery.html`

We have begun the integrations with Clik. Works ok except for captions. The styling for these is kind of hardwired and we will need to improve this. At the minute it's sort of bodgy where we add their required class on the fly.

Note I have changed the CSS to be less specific.

See `testing\css\content_test.cfm`

Note you have to select the test scheme at the bottom. It doesn't reload when you change layout mode in the settings yet.
