# External Section Content

Currently section content has to be included in the main section file.

We want to just use simple markdown files.

We will adopt the YAML front matter standard for adding data. Any of the section fields can be defined in the markdown and this will override any XML definitions.

You can add a src attribute to the section tag to link to a file `src="data/sections/home.md"`
